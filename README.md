## Challenge

Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

Use prompts to accept the 3 sides of a triangle.

An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.

An isosceles triangle has two sides the same length and not the third side.

A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.

For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. See Triangle Inequality.
